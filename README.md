WebDriver Extensions
====================

This project used to be an incubator for WebDriver extensions.

**Incubated extensions:**

* [webdriver-factory](https://github.com/barancev/webdriver-factory) is an utility to manage WebDriver instances
* [decorated-webdriver](https://github.com/barancev/decorated-webdriver) allows to create WebDriver extensions following Decorator design pattern; it also contains several ready-to-use extensions: a wrapper that highlights elements before an action, a wrapper that handles unhandled alerts, a wrapper that handles "stale" elements and attempts to find them again and perform the action on the "restored" element, a wrapper that logs all commands to slf4j, a wrapper that implements client-side waits similar to browser-side impicit waits, but are more intelligent and flexible
